#Branigan

A GNU/Linux program for restricting unproductive internet usage.

## Purpose

Branigan was originally concieved as a port of the excellent [**SelfControl**](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) for macOS, and shares its objective of blocking access to websites you find distracting until a given end time.

## Installation

Currently, Branigan requires CMake and a C++ compiler to be installed.  
First, clone the repository:  
`git clone 

<!-- Branigan has a command line interface only. This was done deliberately, as the average GNU/Linux user tends to be more confident with using a terminal. -->
